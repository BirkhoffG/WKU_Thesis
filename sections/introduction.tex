The content of your project report must be written in English. If Chinese text is not avoidable, then you must provide the English translation of it. Please use double spacing and all texts must be fully justified.

\subsection{Body and Heading 2}
Please use Times/Times New Roman 12 pts for the body text. All heading text must be in bold and numbered, 14 pts for heading level 1, 12 pts for heading level 2, and 12 pts italic for heading level 3. Avoid using heading level 4.


You may use italic or underline to emphasize sentences/words. And you may also use Latin words such as et al., e.g., i.e., etc., cf., viz., and so on. If this is the case, please use them sparsely.


Quotes must be properly put inside quotation marks (“…”) followed by the source (e.g. from [3] page 62). You may use Consolas, Lucida Console, or other monospaced fonts for source code and algorithms.


\subsection{Figures/tables}

Put any figure/table immediately after it is first mentioned or near the text. Do not put all figures/tables at the end of the report. You must insert figure/table caption for each figure and table. All figures and tables must be numbered consecutively; for example, Figure \ref{fig:wku} etc. 


If you want to insert color figures, please use proper colors and the resolution must be high enough for quality prints. 

\begin{figure}
